# freeCodeCamp Project #1 - Responsive Tribute Site - The Freddy Mercury Tribute site

## Intro:

This is my first freeCodeCamp project. In this project I built a responsive tribute site in honor of the late Freddy Mercury, the legendary Queen frontman and a legend of the rock and roll music genre. This one page website covers the life and achievements of Freddy Mercury throughout the years. Most of the information was taken from Freddy Mercury and Quuen's Wikipedia pages.
