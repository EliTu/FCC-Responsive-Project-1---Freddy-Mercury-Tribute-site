# freeCodeCamp Project #1 - Responsive Tribute Site - The Freddy Mercury Tribute site

## Intro:

- This is my first freeCodeCamp project. In this project I built a responsive tribute site in honor of the late Freddy Mercury, the legendary Queen front man and a legend of the rock and roll music genre. This one page website covers the life and achievements of Freddy Mercury throughout the years. Most of the information was taken from Freddy Mercury and Queen's Wikipedia pages.

- This site is made using HTML and CSS rules, no libraries were used in the code. 

- The site is responsive in different screen sizes, and should work and respond well to all screen sizes. The navbar, images, block quotes, text and containers all adjust dynamically according to the screen size.

## The future of this project:

- Make the sticky positioned navbar respond better.

- Get better graphics on the site, make it look less like vanilla CSS colors.

- Add some JavaScript event listeners for scrolling and clicking events(?).
