                                One of Mercury's former bandmates from the Hectics has said "the only music he listened

                                    His technique was astonishing. No problem of tempo, he sang with an incisive sense

                                    first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the
                                    Atlantic</span>.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1975</span> - Queen recorded and released <span class="music">A
                                    Night at the Opera</span>. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever
                                produced. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the
                                United States. <span class="important">A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in

                                featured the hit single <span class="music">Bohemian Rhapsody"</span>, which was number

                                the Opera. The major hit on the album was <span class="music">"Somebody to Love"</span>,
                                a gospel-inspired song in which Mercury, May, and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to
                                create a 100-voice gospel choir.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1977</span> - The band's sixth studio album <span class="music">News

                                songs tailor-made for live performance, including two of rock's most recognisable
                                anthems, <span class="music">"We Will Rock You"</span> and the rock ballad <span class="music">We

                                anthems.</li>

                                    Me Now"</span>, provides another example of the band's exuberant vocal harmonies.</li>

                                which <span class="important">reached number one in the US. The album topped the
                                    Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US</span>.
                                It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1981</span> - Queen travelled to South America as part of <span
                                    class="music">The Game Tour</span>, and became <span class="important">the first
                                    major rock band to play in Latin American stadiums</span>. The tour included five

                                    concert crowd in Argentine history with an audience of 300,000 in Buenos Aires</span>.
                                Queen worked with <span class="name">David Bowie</span> on the single <span class="music">"Under

                                    stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there

                            <li><span class="years">1973</span> - Mercury's first solo effort goes back to 1972 under
                                the pseudonym <span class="name">Larry Lurex</span>, when Trident Studios' house
                                engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen
                                were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the
                                songs <span class="music">"I Can Hear Music"</span> and <span class="music">"Goin'
                                    Back"</span>, both were released together as a single in 1973.</li>

                                Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes Mr. Bad Guy as "outstanding from start to
                                finish" and expressed his view that Mercury <q>did a commendable job of stretching into
                                    uncharted territory</q>. In particular, the album is heavily synthesiser-driven in
                                a way that is not characteristic of previous Queen albums.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1988</span> - Mercury released His second album, <span class="music">Barcelona</span>,
                                recorded with Spanish soprano vocalist <span class="name">Montserrat Caball√©</span>,
                                combines elements of popular music and opera. <span class="important">Many critics were
                                    uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as "the most bizarre CD of
                                    the year"</span>. The album was a commercial success, and the album's title track
                                debuted at No. 8 in the UK and was also a hit in Spain.</li>
                            <li>n addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several singles, including his own
                                version of the hit <span class="music">"The Great Pretender"</span> by The Platters,
                                which debuted at No. 5 in the UK in 1987.</li>

                                    Hutton</span>, <span class="important">Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in late
                                    April 1987</span>. Around that time, Mercury claimed in an interview to have tested

                            <li><span class="years">1990</span> - By 1990, the rumours about Mercury's health were
                                rife. At the 1990 Brit Awards held at the Dominion Theatre, London, on 18 February,
                                <span class="important">a visibly frail Mercury made his final appearance on stage</span>

                                band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour
                                or two at a time. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and
                                he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed. <span class="important">Due
                                    to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take
                                    his medication and continued taking only painkillers</span>. On 22 November 1991,
                                Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach over to his Kensington home to discuss a
                                public statement, which was released the following day. <span class="important">On the
                                    evening of 24 November 1991, just over 24 hours after issuing that statement,

                                "I will finish it when I come back, next time"; however, he never made it back into the
