                                One of Mercury's former bandmates from the Hectics has said "the only music he listened
                                to, and played, was Western pop music."A friend from the time recalls that <q>he had an

                                    His technique was astonishing. No problem of tempo, he sang with an incisive sense
                                    of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly

                                    well throughout Europe, and went gold in the United States. It gave the band their
                                    first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the
                                    Atlantic</span>.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1975</span> - Queen recorded and released <span class="music">A
                                    Night at the Opera</span>. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever
                                produced. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the
                                United States. <span class="important">A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in
                                    "greatest albums" lists </span>reflecting the opinions of critics. The album also
                                featured the hit single <span class="music">Bohemian Rhapsody"</span>, which was number

                                the Opera. The major hit on the album was <span class="music">"Somebody to Love"</span>,
                                a gospel-inspired song in which Mercury, May, and Taylor multi-tracked their voices to
                                create a 100-voice gospel choir.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1977</span> - The band's sixth studio album <span class="music">News

                                songs tailor-made for live performance, including two of rock's most recognisable
                                anthems, <span class="music">"We Will Rock You"</span> and the rock ballad <span class="music">We

                                anthems.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1978</span> - The band released <span class="music">Jazz</span>,

                                double-sided record. Another notable track from Jazz, <span class="music">"Don't Stop
                                    Me Now"</span>, provides another example of the band's exuberant vocal harmonies.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1980</span> - Queen began their 1980s career with <span class="music">The
                                    Game</span>. It featured the singles <span class="music">"Crazy Little Thing Called

                                which <span class="important">reached number one in the US. The album topped the
                                    Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US</span>.
                                It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1981</span> - Queen travelled to South America as part of <span
                                    class="music">The Game Tour</span>, and became <span class="important">the first
                                    major rock band to play in Latin American stadiums</span>. The tour included five
                                shows in Argentina, <span class="important">one of which drew the largest single
                                    concert crowd in Argentine history with an audience of 300,000 in Buenos Aires</span>.
                                Queen worked with <span class="name">David Bowie</span> on the single <span class="music">"Under

                                from 1974 to 1981. <span class="important">It is the best-selling album in UK Chart

                            <li><span class="years">1982</span> - The band released the album <span class="music">Hot
                                    Space</span>, a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a
                                mixture of rock, pop rock, dance, funk, and R&B. <span class="important">The band
                                    stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there
                                    had waned</span>, although they would perform on American television.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1983</span> - After working steadily for over ten years, Queen

                            <li><span class="years">1984</span> - Queen released their eleventh studio album, <span

                                    audience of 1.9 billion, Queen performed some of their greatest hits, during which
                                    the sold-out stadium audience of 72,000 people clapped, sang, and swayed in unison</span>.

                                Stone, MTV, The Telegraph among others, <span class="important">stated that Queen stole
                                    the show</span>. <span class="important">An industry poll in 2005 ranked it the
                                    greatest rock performance of all time</span>. Mercury's powerful, sustained note
                                during the a cappella section came to be known as <span class="important">The Note

                                    his Dionysian Live Aid performance, was easily the most godlike of them all.</q>
                                The band, now revitalised by the response to Live Aid – a "shot in the arm" Roger
                                Taylor called it, — and the ensuing increase in record sales, ended 1985 by releasing
                                the single <span class="music">"One Vision"</span>.</li>

                            <li><span class="years">1973</span> - Mercury's first solo effort goes back to 1972 under
                                the pseudonym <span class="name">Larry Lurex</span>, when Trident Studios' house
                                engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a musical project, at the time when Queen
                                were recording their debut album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the
                                songs <span class="music">"I Can Hear Music"</span> and <span class="music">"Goin'
                                    Back"</span>, both were released together as a single in 1973.</li>

                                Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes Mr. Bad Guy as "outstanding from start to
                                finish" and expressed his view that Mercury <q>did a commendable job of stretching into
                                    uncharted territory</q>. In particular, the album is heavily synthesiser-driven in
                                a way that is not characteristic of previous Queen albums.</li>
                            <li><span class="years">1988</span> - Mercury released His second album, <span class="music">Barcelona</span>,
                                recorded with Spanish soprano vocalist <span class="name">Montserrat Caballé</span>,
                                combines elements of popular music and opera. <span class="important">Many critics were
                                    uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as "the most bizarre CD of
                                    the year"</span>. The album was a commercial success, and the album's title track
                                debuted at No. 8 in the UK and was also a hit in Spain.</li>
                            <li>n addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several singles, including his own
                                version of the hit <span class="music">"The Great Pretender"</span> by The Platters,
                                which debuted at No. 5 in the UK in 1987.</li>
                            <li>In 1981–1983 Mercury recorded several tracks with <span class="name">Michael Jackson</span>,

                                    Hutton</span>, <span class="important">Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in late
                                    April 1987</span>. Around that time, Mercury claimed in an interview to have tested

                            <li><span class="years">1990</span> - By 1990, the rumours about Mercury's health were
                                rife. At the 1990 Brit Awards held at the Dominion Theatre, London, on 18 February,
                                <span class="important">a visibly frail Mercury made his final appearance on stage</span>

                                band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, for an hour
                                or two at a time. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and
                                he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed. <span class="important">Due
                                    to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take
                                    his medication and continued taking only painkillers</span>. On 22 November 1991,
                                Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach over to his Kensington home to discuss a
                                public statement, which was released the following day. <span class="important">On the
                                    evening of 24 November 1991, just over 24 hours after issuing that statement,
                                    Mercury died at the age of 45 at his home in Kensington</span>. <span class="important">Both

                                penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he "wasn't feeling that great" and stated,
                                "I will finish it when I come back, next time"; however, he never made it back into the
